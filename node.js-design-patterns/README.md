# Preface

- The biggest innovation of the decade:
  - Javascript
  - Single-threaded programming model and its asynchronous architecture.
  - Its ecosystem.

# Chapter 1: The Node.js Platform

- The Node.js philosophy:
  - Small core
  - Small modules
    - Easier to understand and use
    - Simpler to test and maintain
    - Small in size and perfect for use in the browser
  - Small sureface area
  - Simplicity and pragmatism
- How Node.js works:
  - I/O is slow
  - blocking I/O
  - nonblocking I/O
  - reactor pattern
  - livuv, the I/O engine
- JavaScript in Node.js
  - Run the latest JavaScript with confidence
  - The module system
  - Full access to operating system services
  - Running native code

# Chapter 2: The Module System

- The need for modules:
  - Having a way to split the codebase into multiple files.
